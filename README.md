Data Analytics Project Showcasing customer behavior analysis using python, sql and power bi

Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Workflow

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end Data Analytics lifecycle starting from loading raw data in Python, performing exploratory analysis, cleaning and transforming data, executing SQL queries, and finally visualizing insights through a Power BI dashboard and a Gamma presentation.

The goal is to show how a data analyst moves from raw dataset → insights → business-ready report.

📂 Dataset

Source: CSV dataset (replace with your dataset name)

Size: Medium (5,000–50,000 rows)

Contains metrics such as sales, customers, orders, products, regions, and dates

Data issues handled: missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats



---

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Power BI (Dashboard development)

Gamma App (Automated presentation)

GitHub (Version control & project documentation)

✅ Project Steps

1️⃣ Data Loading (Python)

Imported the CSV using Pandas

Checked dataset shape, datatypes, column names, and initial structure


2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics

Feature distributions

Trend & correlation analysis

Identification of outliers


3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation

Handling missing values (mean/median/imputation)

Removing duplicates

Formatting dates & categorical values

Creating new calculated fields (e.g., total sales, profit margin)


4️⃣ SQL Analysis

Performed SQL queries to extract deeper insights:

Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Joins across multiple tables

Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK)

Filtering, grouping, sorting

Time-based calculations (monthly trends, YoY growth)


5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

Connected cleaned dataset

Created interactive visuals:

KPI Cards

Bar/Line charts

Category segmentation

Region-wise performance

Slicers for dynamic filtering


Storytelling layout: Overview → Trends → Deep Insights


6️⃣ Final Reporting

Summarized findings in a Gamma presentation

Visual narrative: business problem → patterns → insights → recommendations
